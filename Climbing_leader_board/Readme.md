# Overview

This README outlines the dense ranking system used in the arcade game leaderboard. The system ranks players based on scores, ensuring a clear and sequential ranking order while handling ties.

# Rules

- **Highest Score**: Top score = Rank 1.
- **Equal Scores**: Tied scores share the same rank. The next rank is adjusted accordingly.
- **Sequential Rankings**: Next ranks follow the score differences.

# How It Works

1. **Sorting Scores**: Scores are sorted from highest to lowest.
2. **Assigning Ranks**: Sequential ranks are assigned based on scores.

# Example

Example Scores:
```
Player A: 100
Player B: 90
Player C: 85
Player D: 85
Player E: 75
```

Corresponding Ranks:
```
Player A: Rank 1
Player B: Rank 2
Player C: Rank 3
Player D: Rank 3
Player E: Rank 4
```

# Usage

The dense ranking logic ensures fair player rankings on the game leaderboard.
