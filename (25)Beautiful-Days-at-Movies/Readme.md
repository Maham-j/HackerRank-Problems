# Beautiful Days 

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Beautiful Days challenge! In this problem, Lily has created a game involving integers where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. She wants to apply this game to decision making to determine beautiful days in a range of numbered days.

## 📝 Problem Description

Lily defines beautiful days as those where the absolute difference between a number and its reverse is evenly divisible by a given number `k`. Given a range of numbered days `[i...j]` and a number `k`, your task is to determine the number of beautiful days in that range.

### Function Description

You're required to create a function that calculates the number of beautiful days in the given range.

#### Function Signature

```python
def count_beautiful_days(i, j, k):
    pass
```

#### Parameters

- **i**: An integer representing the start of the range.
- **j**: An integer representing the end of the range.
- **k**: An integer representing the divisor.

#### Returns

- **int**: The number of beautiful days in the range `[i...j]`.

## 🧠 Implementation Details

Implement the `count_beautiful_days` function that counts the number of beautiful days in the given range `[i...j]` using the condition |i - reverse(i)| % k == 0.

## 🌟 Example

```python
# Example usage of the count_beautiful_days function
i = 20
j = 23
k = 6

beautiful_days = count_beautiful_days(i, j, k)  # Counts the beautiful days in the range

print(beautiful_days)  # Output: 2
```

## 🚨 Important Note

Ensure that your function accurately calculates the number of beautiful days in the specified range according to the given condition.
