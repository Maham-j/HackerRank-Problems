## Problem Statement

Lily and Ron want to share a chocolate bar. Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar such that the segment's length matches Ron's birth month and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day. The script determines how many ways Lily can divide the chocolate.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chocolate-bar-division.git
cd chocolate-bar-division
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python chocolate_bar_division.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to provide the required input.

## Input Format

The script prompts you to provide the following input:

1. The number of squares on the chocolate bar.
2. The integers on each square.
3. Ron's birth day and birth month.

## Example

Suppose you run the script and provide the following input:

```
5
1 2 1 3 2
3 2
```

The script will output:

```
2
```

This means that there are 2 ways Lily can divide the chocolate bar according to the given conditions.
