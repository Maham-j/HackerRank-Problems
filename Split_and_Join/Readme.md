# Split and Join Function 🚀

## Overview ℹ️

## Functionality 🛠️
The `split_and_join` function takes a string as input, splits it based on spaces, and joins the resulting substrings using hyphens instead of spaces. It utilizes the `replace` method to achieve this transformation.

## How to Use 📝

2. Enter a string when prompted.
3. The program will display the modified string with spaces replaced by hyphens.

## Example ✨
