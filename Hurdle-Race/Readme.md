# 🏁 Hurdle Race Magic Potion Calculator 🧪

## Overview
This tool helps you determine how many magic potion doses your character needs to clear all hurdles in a video game. No need to worry; we'll keep it short and sweet!

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your character's max jump height and the hurdle heights.
3. You'll instantly get the dose count needed, or a message if none are required.

## Example
Character max jump: 5 units
Hurdle heights: [3, 4, 5, 6]
Result: 1 dose needed.

## Note
If your character can already clear all hurdles, you'll be notified – save those doses for later!
