# 🏃‍♂️ Hurdle Race Magic Potion Calculator 🧪

## Overview
Welcome to the Hurdle Race Magic Potion Calculator! This simple program is designed to help video game enthusiasts determine how many doses of a magical potion their character needs to conquer all the hurdles in a thrilling race.

In the game, the character faces hurdles of varying heights, and they have a maximum jump height they can achieve. However, they can boost their jump height by taking a magical potion. The goal is to figure out how many doses of the potion are required to clear all the hurdles. 🎮

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to enter the maximum jump height of your character and a list of hurdle heights.
3. The program will calculate the number of potion doses needed to clear all the hurdles, or it will inform you that no doses are necessary if your character can already clear them all.

## Example
Let's say your character can jump up to 5 units high, and there are hurdles with heights [3, 4, 5, 6]. After running the program, it will tell you that your character needs 1 dose of the magic potion to clear all the hurdles.

## Important Note
If your character can already clear all the hurdles without any potions, the program will remind you that no doses are required. So, you can save those magical elixirs for a more challenging race!

Enjoy the game, and may your character clear every hurdle with style! 🚀✨
