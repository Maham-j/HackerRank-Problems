# Cats & Mouse Game 🐱🐭

Welcome to the Cats & Mouse game! In this simple and fun challenge, you'll decide the fate of two cats, Cat A and Cat B, as they chase after a cunning mouse, Mouse C. Here's how it works:

**Objective:** Determine which cat will reach the mouse first, or if the cats will reach the mouse simultaneously.

# **How to Play:**
- You'll be given a series of queries, each with three positions: x, y, and z.
    - `x` is Cat A's starting position 🐱.
    - `y` is Cat B's starting position 🐱.
    - `z` is Mouse C's starting position 🐭.

# **Outcomes:**
- If Cat A catches the mouse first, print "Cat A."
- If Cat B catches the mouse first, print "Cat B."
- If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print "Mouse C" as the cats fight and the mouse escapes.

# **Example:** 
For instance, if Cat A starts at 1, Cat B starts at 3, and Mouse C starts at 2, Cat A will catch the mouse first, so you'd print "Cat A."
