# Grading Policy Rounding Tool 📚
 
This Python script automates the grading process according to HackerLand University's policy.

## How It Works 🔍

1. Input the total number of students, `n`, and their grades.

2. The script rounds grades per the rules:
    - If the grade is < 38, it remains unchanged.
    - If the grade % 5 is not zero, it's rounded up to the next multiple of 5.

3. Grades with a difference < 3 are rounded, while others are kept as is.

4. Output displays original grades, rounded grades, and the final grade list.

## Usage 🔧

1. Run the script in Python.

2. Input student count and grades.

3. Get the rounded grades as per the university's policy.

## Customization ⚙️

Feel free to customize the script:
- Modify rounding logic.
- Adjust grading policy conditions.
