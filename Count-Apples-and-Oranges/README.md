## Problem Statement

Sam's house 🏠 has an apple tree 🌳 and an orange tree 🌳 that yield an abundance of fruit. Given the house's range, the positions of the trees, the distances at which apples and oranges fell, the script determines the number of apples 🍏 and oranges 🍊 that land on Sam's house.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-orange-counter.git
cd apple-orange-counter
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python apple_orange_counter.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to provide the required input.

## Input Format

The script prompts you to provide the following input:

1. The starting and ending points of the house 🏠 (s, t).
2. The positions of the apple tree 🌳 and orange tree 🌳 (a, b).
3. The number of apples 🍏 and oranges 🍊 (m, n).
4. The distances at which apples fell.
5. The distances at which oranges fell.

## Example

Suppose you run the script and provide the following input:

```
7 11
5 15
3 2
-2 2 1
5 -6
```

The script will output:

```
1
1
```

This means that 1 apple 🍏 and 1 orange 🍊 landed on Sam's house.
