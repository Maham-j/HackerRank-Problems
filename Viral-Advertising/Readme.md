# Viral Advertising Strategy 

## 🚀 Introduction 

Welcome to the Viral Advertising Strategy problem! HackerLand Enterprise has adopted a new advertising strategy for its product launch, targeting a specific number of people through social media. They aim to track the number of people who like the advertisement by leveraging a specific sharing algorithm.

## 📝 Problem Description

When launching a new product, HackerLand advertises it to exactly 5 people on social media. The advertisement is initially liked by half of these 5 people, and each shares it with a specific number of friends. The process continues, where on each subsequent day, half of the recipients from the previous day like the ad and share it with their friends.

### Function Description

Your task is to create a function that determines how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, starting with the launch day as day 1.

#### Function Signature

```python
def viral_advertising(n):
    pass
```

#### Parameter

- **n**: An integer representing the day for which the number of people who liked the advertisement needs to be calculated.

#### Returns

- **int**: The total number of people who liked the advertisement by the end of day `n`.

## 🧠 Implementation Details

Implement the `viral_advertising` function that calculates the total number of people who liked the advertisement by the end of the given day, following the sharing algorithm explained in the problem description.

## 🌟 Example

```python
# Example usage of the viral_advertising function
day = 5

liked = viral_advertising(day)  # Calculates the total people who liked the ad by day 5

print(liked)  # Output: 24
```

## 🚨 Important Note

Ensure that your function correctly computes the total number of people who liked the advertisement by the end of the specified day based on the provided sharing algorithm.
