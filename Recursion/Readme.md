# Factorial Function 

## 🌀 Introduction

Welcome to the Factorial Function challenge! In this task, you're tasked with implementing the `factorial` function using recursion. The `factorial` function should calculate the factorial of a given integer `n`.

## 📝 Task Overview

Your objective is to create a recursive function named `factorial` or `Factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of `n`. It's crucial to implement this function using recursion.

## 🧠 Implementation Details

### Function: `factorial(n)`

#### Parameters

- **n**: An integer for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

#### Return Value

- **int**: The factorial of the input integer `n`.

#### Methodology

The `factorial` function should be implemented using recursion, calculating the factorial by repeatedly multiplying the number with the factorial of the preceding number until reaching the base case.

## 🌟 Example

```python
# Example usage of the factorial function
result = factorial(5)  # Calculates factorial of 5 (5! = 5*4*3*2*1)

print(result)  # Output: 120
```

## 🚨 Important Note

Ensure that you implement the function using recursion and name it `factorial` or `Factorial`. Failure to do so will result in a score of 0.
