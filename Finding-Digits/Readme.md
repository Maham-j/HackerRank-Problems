## Divisor Counter README

## Description:📝
This program determines the count of divisors within an integer by analyzing each digit that makes up the number. A divisor is defined as a digit that evenly divides the given integer without leaving a remainder.

## Getting Started:🚀 
To use this program, ensure you have a Python environment set up. You can clone this repository or simply copy the provided code into your Python editor.

## Usage:🔧 
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the integer when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the count of divisors within the entered integer.

## Functionality:⚙️ 
The program employs a simple algorithm to iterate through each digit of the entered integer. For each digit, it checks whether it can evenly divide the integer without leaving a remainder. If so, it counts that digit as a divisor.

## Example:📋 
For example, given the integer 4620:
- Digit 4 is a divisor because 4620 % 4 == 0
- Digit 6 is a divisor because 4620 % 6 == 0
- Digit 2 is a divisor because 4620 % 2 == 0
- Digit 0 is not considered as a divisor (division by zero is undefined)

Therefore, the count of divisors within the integer 4620 is 3.
