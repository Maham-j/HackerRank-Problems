There is an array of  integers. There are also  disjoint sets,  and , each containing  integers. 
You like all the integers in set  and dislike all the integers in set . Your initial happiness is . 
For each  integer in the array, if , you add  to your happiness. If , you add  to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Note: Since  and  are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.





# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Read n and m from the first line
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read the elements of the array from the second line
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Read the elements of set A from the third line
A = set(map(int, input().split()))

# Read the elements of set B from the fourth line
B = set(map(int, input().split()))

for num in arr:
    if num in A:
        happiness +=1
    elif num in B:
        happiness -=1
