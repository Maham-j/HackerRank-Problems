## 📄 PDF Text Selection Area Calculator

---

## 📝 Description:

This program helps calculate the area of the rectangle highlight in a PDF viewer when a string of text is selected. It considers the individual character heights and assumes each letter is 1mm wide.

## 🔢 Character Heights:

The character heights are listed from 'a' to 'z', aligned by index to their respective letters. For instance, 'a' corresponds to index 0, and 'z' corresponds to index 25.

## 🔍 How to Use:

1. Input the string of text you want to calculate the selection area for.
2. Utilize the provided character heights to determine the height of each letter in the string.
3. The program will compute and display the area of the rectangle highlight in mm².

## 📊 Calculating Selection Area:

The calculation assumes each letter is 1mm wide and multiplies this width by the sum of individual character heights in the selected text.

## 🚀 Getting Started:

To use this program, simply access the provided function or method within your code and pass the text string as an argument to obtain the selection area.

## 📌 Note:

Ensure the character heights and text string are accurately aligned for precise area calculation.

## 🔧 Example Usage:

```python
from pdf_selection_area_calculator import calculate_selection_area

text = "example text" # Replace with your text
area = calculate_selection_area(text)
print(f"The selection area for '{text}' is {area} mm².")
```
