# ⏰ Time-Based Greeting Script ⏰

Welcome to the Time-Based Greeting Script! This Python script allows you to greet someone based on the current time of the day. Below, you'll find the script and a brief explanation of how it works.

# 📜 Description:

The Time-Based Greeting Script utilizes the `time` module to retrieve the current time in the format HH:MM:SS. It then compares the time with predefined intervals to determine the appropriate greeting for the time of the day: morning, afternoon, evening, or night.

# 🚀 How to Use:
1. Open the script in your preferred Python environment.

2. Run the script.

3. The current timestamp will be printed.

4. The script will then greet "Maham" based on the time of the day.

# 🛠️ Customization:

You can easily customize the script to greet any person you'd like. Replace "Maham" with the desired name in the greetings.

# 🧩 Example:

Current timestamp: 15:42:17

Output: Good Afternoon Maham
