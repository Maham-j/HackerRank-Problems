# 🎂 **Birthday Candle Counter** 🕯️

This simple Python script helps you determine the number of candles you should light for a child's birthday cake, where each candle represents a year of their age. The script identifies the tallest candles and counts how many of them there are, ensuring the birthday child has a memorable and candle-filled celebration!

#  🎈 **Problem Statement** 🎁
 
You're entrusted with creating a cake for a child's birthday. The cake's uniqueness lies in the fact that it will have one candle for each year of the child's age. However, the child can only blow out the tallest candles. Your task is to count how many candles share the highest height.

# 💡 **Solution Approach** 🍰

The script `birthdayCakeCandles()` first takes the total number of candles `n` as input. It then records the height of each candle, one by one. After gathering the heights, the script identifies the tallest candle among them. Finally, it counts how many candles are of the tallest height and returns this count.

# 📝 **Usage** 🕰️

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

2. Enter the total number of candles as input.

3. Input the height of each candle, one by one.

# 📚 **Code Overview** 🖋️

The script contains the following key steps:

1. `n = int(input())` - Read the total number of candles.

2. `arr = []` - Initialize an array to store the heights of individual candles.

3. `tallest_candle = 0` - Initialize the height of the tallest candle.

4. `count = 0` - Initialize the count of the tallest candles.

5. Loop through each candle's height input and add it to the array.

6. Find the tallest candle's height.

7. Count the number of candles with the tallest height.

8. Return the count of the tallest candles.
