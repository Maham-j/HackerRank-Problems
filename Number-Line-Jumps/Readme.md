## Kangaroo Show Choreography 🦘🎪

## Problem Description: 📝
Choreograph a circus act where two kangaroos on a number line jump towards positive infinity. Given their starting locations and jump rates:
- First kangaroo: Starts at `x1`, jumps `v1` meters.
- Second kangaroo: Starts at `x2`, jumps `v2` meters.

Your goal: Ensure both kangaroos land at the same location simultaneously. Return `YES` if possible; otherwise, `NO`.

---

## Algorithm Approach: ⚙️
1. Simulate kangaroos' movement on the number line.
2. Check if their positions match after any jump.
3. Return `YES` if positions coincide; otherwise, `NO`.

---

## Function: 📋

`canKangaroosMeet(x1, v1, x2, v2)`:
- `x1`: First kangaroo's starting location.
- `v1`: First kangaroo's jump rate.
- `x2`: Second kangaroo's starting location.
- `v2`: Second kangaroo's jump rate.

Returns:
- `YES` if both kangaroos can land together.
- `NO` if it's impossible for them to meet.

## Example: 🎯

```python
# Sample Input
x1 = 0
v1 = 3
x2 = 4
v2 = 2

# Function Call
result = canKangaroosMeet(x1, v1, x2, v2)

# Output
print(result)  # Output will be "YES"
```

## Complexity: 📊
- Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time due to simple calculations.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space usage.
