## Problem Statement

Anna and Brian are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. The script determines if his calculation is correct. 

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bon-appetit-calculator.git
cd bon-appetit-calculator
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python bon_appetit_calculator.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to provide the required input.

## Input Format

The script prompts you to provide the following input:

1. The number of items on the bill (n) and the item Anna did not eat (k).
2. The cost of each item on the bill.
3. The amount Anna paid (b).

## Example

Suppose you run the script and provide the following input:

```
3 2
2 4 6
6
```

The script will output:

```
3
```

This means that the bill was incorrectly split, and Brian owes Anna a refund of 3.
