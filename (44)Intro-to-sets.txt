Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Formula used:
		sum of distinct heights/total no of distinct heights





def average(array):
    # your code goes here
    conversion = set(arr)
    length = len(conversion)
    
    total = 0
    for i in conversion:
        total +=i
        
    average = total/length
    return average
        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)S
