# 🎮 FizzBuzz Game  🎮

Welcome to the FizzBuzz game! This classic programming exercise is a fun and educational way to practice your coding skills. Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started and enjoy the game.

## 📜 Description:

FizzBuzz is a simple game where players take turns counting up from 1. However, there's a twist! When the number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" 🍬. When it's divisible by 5, say "Buzz" 🚀. And if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz" 🍭. If none of these conditions apply, just say the number itself.

## 🚀 How to Play:

1. **Gather a group of players.**

2. **Decide who starts counting.**

3. **Each player takes turns counting up in sequential order, following the FizzBuzz rules.**

4. **If a player makes a mistake, they're out of the game.**

5. **Continue until only one player remains or until a predefined count is reached.**

## 💡 Tips:

- Take your time and think before you speak to avoid mistakes.

- Remember the FizzBuzz rules: divisible by 3, say "Fizz"; divisible by 5, say "Buzz"; divisible by both, say "FizzBuzz".

- Have fun and encourage each other!

## 🛠️ Customization:

Feel free to customize the game rules to make it more challenging or suitable for your group. You can change the divisors, add more conditions, or even introduce penalties for mistakes.

## 🧩 Example:
- Player 1: 1
- Player 2: 2
- Player 3: Fizz
- Player 4: 4
- Player 5: Buzz
- Player 6: Fizz
- ...
